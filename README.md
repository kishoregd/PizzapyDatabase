# Pizzapy Database
Pizzapy Database setup in SQL Server

Pizzapy database represents an order processing data capture of a fictional Pizza Chain called  Pizzapy Inc.  My plan is to enhance this data model as and when necessary. At this point Pizzapy database model represents an OLTP relational database mainly created for sample data purposes.  By the way, real world pizza order processing data capture is a way more complex and as a Solution & Data Architect I would not really recommend this model for any other purposes other than learning.
